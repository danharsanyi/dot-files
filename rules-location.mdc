# Cursor Rules Location

Standards for organizing Cursor rule files in the repository.

## Rule: cursor_rules_location

**Description**: All Cursor rule files must be placed in the `.cursor/rules` directory

**Requirements**:

1. Location: Rule files must be placed in `WORKSPACE_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`
2. Extension: Must use `.mdc` file extension
3. Naming: Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `my-rule-name.mdc`)
4. Structure: Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

**Directory Structure**:

```markdown
WORKSPACE_ROOT/
├── gql-practitioner/
├── gql-admin/
├── protobufs/
├── svc-core-example/
├── svc.core.example/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
│       ├── another-rule.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

**Examples**:

- ✅ Correct: `.cursor/rules/my-rule.mdc`
- ✅ Correct: `.cursor/rules/linear-ticket-implementation.mdc`
- ❌ Incorrect: `rules/my-rule.mdc`
- ❌ Incorrect: `my-rule.mdc`
- ❌ Incorrect: `.rules/my-rule.mdc`

**Note**: This rule file itself follows these standards by being located in `.cursor/rules/rules-location.mdc`
